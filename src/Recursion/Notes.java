	/*
	 * 1. Identify if you can break the bigger problem into smaller ones
	 * 2. Write the recurrence relation (Ex: for fibonacci series: fib(n-1) + fib(n=2))
	 * 3. Draw the recursion tree
	 * 4. About the tree
	 * 	a) See the flow of function, how they are getting in Stack
	 * 	b) Identify and focus on left tree calls and right tree calls
	 * 	c) Draw the tree and pointer again and again using pen and paper
	 * 	d) use the debugger to see the flow 
	 * 5. See how the values are returned at each step
